VGen is an open-source video synthesis codebase developed by the Tongyi Lab of Alibaba Group, featuring state-of-the-art video generative models. This repository includes implementations of the following methods:


- [I2VGen-xl: High-quality image-to-video synthesis via cascaded diffusion models](https://i2vgen-xl.github.io/)
- [VideoComposer: Compositional Video Synthesis with Motion Controllability](https://videocomposer.github.io/)
- [Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Decoupling for Text-to-Video Generation](https://higen-t2v.github.io/)
- [A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos]()
- [InstructVideo: Instructing Video Diffusion Models with Human Feedback]()
- [DreamVideo: Composing Your Dream Videos with Customized Subject and Motion](https://dreamvideo-t2v.github.io/)
- [VideoLCM: Video Latent Consistency Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09109)
- [Modelscope text-to-video technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06571)


VGen can produce high-quality videos from the input text, images, desired motion, desired subjects, and even the feedback signals provided.  It also offers a variety of commonly used video generation tools such as visualization, sampling, training, inference, join training using images and videos, acceleration, and more.

- Completeness, encompassing all common components for video generation.
- Excellent performance, featuring powerful pre-trained models in multiple tasks.


### Installation

```
conda create -n vgen python=3.8
conda activate vgen
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 torchvision==0.13.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

### Datasets

We have provided a **demo dataset** that includes images and videos, along with their lists in ``data``. 

*Please note that the demo images used here are for testing purposes and were not included in the training.*


### Clone codeb

```
git clone https://github.com/damo-vilab/i2vgen-xl.git
cd i2vgen-xl
```


## Getting Started with VGen

### (1) Train your text-to-video model


Executing the following command to enable distributed training is as easy as that.
```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/t2v_train.yaml
```

In the `t2v_train.yaml` configuration file, you can specify the data, adjust the video-to-image ratio using `frame_lens`, and validate your ideas with different Diffusion settings, and so on.

- Before the training, you can download any of our open-source models for initialization. Our codebase supports custom initialization and `grad_scale` settings, all of which are included in the `Pretrain` item in yaml file.
- During the training, you can view the saved models and intermediate inference results in the `workspace/experiments/t2v_train`directory.

After the training is completed, you can perform inference on the model using the following command.
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/t2v_infer.yaml
```
Then you can find the videos you generated in the `workspace/experiments/test_img_01` directory. For specific configurations such as data, models, seed, etc., please refer to the `t2v_infer.yaml` file.

  </tr>
</center>
</table>
</center>


### (2) Run the I2VGen-XL model

(i) Download model and test data:
```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('damo/I2VGen-XL', cache_dir='models/', revision='v1.0.0')
```

(ii) Run the following command:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/i2vgen_xl_infer.yaml
```
or you can run:
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/i2vgen_xl_infer.yaml  test_list_path data/test_list_for_i2vgen.txt test_model models/i2vgen_xl_00854500.pth
```
The `test_list_path` represents the input image path and its corresponding caption. Please refer to the specific format and suggestions within demo file `data/test_list_for_i2vgen.txt`. `test_model` is the path for loading the model. In a few minutes, you can retrieve the high-definition video you wish to create from the `workspace/experiments/test_list_for_i2vgen` directory. At present, we find that the current model performs inadequately on **anime images** and **images with a black background** due to the lack of relevant training data. We are consistently working to optimize it.
